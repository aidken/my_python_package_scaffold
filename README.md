## installation

I do not put my package in [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). Download the package, maybe in a zip file format, unzip it, and install it from the current directory. Command you should run is:

`python -m pip install ./  # install from the current directory.`

After installation, you can optionally run tests with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/).

`pytest ./tests`



## what I don't understand...

`pyproject.toml` and `setup.py` has many settings in common. What is `pyproject.toml` for?
